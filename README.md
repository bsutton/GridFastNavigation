# GridFastNavigation Add-on for Vaadin 7

Do you like the Grid but would want it to appeal more to old Excel jockeys?
Then this add-on is for you!
GridFastNavigation is a compnent extension for Vaadin Grid, which uses the
unbuffered editing mode and alters its keyboard controls to provide a faster
editing experience.

## Development with Eclipse IDE

For further development of this add-on, the following tool-chain is recommended:
- Eclipse IDE
- m2e wtp plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Vaadin Eclipse plug-in (install it from Eclipse Marketplace)
- Chrome browser

### Importing project

Choose File > Import... > Existing Maven Projects

Note that Eclipse may give "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" errors for pom.xml. Use "Permanently mark goal resources in pom.xml as ignored in Eclipse build" quick-fix to mark these errors as permanently ignored in your project. Do not worry, the project still works fine. 

### Debugging server-side

If you have not already compiled the widgetset, do it now by running vaadin:install Maven target for GridFastNavigation-root project.

If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your GridFastNavigation-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the GridFastNavigation-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/GridFastNavigation-demo/ to see the application.

### Debugging client-side

Debugging client side code in the GridFastNavigation-demo project:
  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application or by adding ?superdevmode to the URL
  - You can access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
 
## Release notes

### Version 0.5.5
- Fixed minor issue: row edit event not triggered when in bottom right corner
- Fixed issue with mouse navigation producing excess row edit events

### Version 0.5.4
- Added option to change column when enter key is pressed on last row (provided that enter key is in row change mode)
- Added more java docs
- Small bug fix with potential index out of bounds issue

### Version 0.5.3
- Small fix. Editor is now opened with single click also.

### Version 0.5.2
- Added support for pageup/down keys in edit mode.
- Added possibility configure enter key to change column instead of row
- Updated the demo

### Version 0.5.1
- Added support for ComboBox in the edit fields of the editor.
- Updated the demo

### Version 0.5.0
- Added support for CheckBox in the edit fields of the editor.
- Updated the demo

### Version 0.4.0
- Fixed to be compatible with 7.7.7 and newer. With older framework versions (7.6.0 to 7.7.6) you need to use 0.3.0

### Version 0.3.0
- Implemented the RowEditEvent and CellEditEvent logic
- Fixed a bug: Pressing Esc should cancel edit and reset the value
- Added Home/End key support: Home - first row, End - last row, Shift+Home - first column on first row, Shift+End last column on last row

### Version 0.2.1:

Moving editor outside the first or last row will cause the editor to save and close. This fixes a usability issue with single-row Grids. Future versions will have this behavior toggleable, once I introduce explicit save-and-close shortcuts.

### Version 0.2.0

- Complete rewrite and architectural redesign
- Customizable open and close shortcuts
- Server-side focus tracking events either on per-cell or per-row basis
- Editor open/close events
- Opening editor by typing can be enabled and disabled
- Keyboard up/down arrow navigation can be enabled and disabled
- DateFields now don't stop working after using up/down arrow navigation
- Selecting text when opening editor can be enabled and disabled
- Tab navigation now skips disabled columns
- Additional columns can be disabled on a per-row basis using editor open event

NOTE: server-side notification of changed data has been removed (for now), but can be emulated using editor open/close events, which are now sent per row.

### Version 0.1-SNAPSHOT

- Initial release. Expect dragons. :)
